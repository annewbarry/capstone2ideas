High Level Description
You should answer the question of "What are you trying to do". Note, you will use ML, stats ect. You're trying to solve a problem, and as such, this bullet should focus on something that has general appeal.
Your Approach
Here, you can get into the specifics of what type of modeling you'd like to employ. It's reasonable to say that your approach may be informed by the EDA process, but you want to have a default plan of attack.

How will people interact with your work
Does your project give insight into a particular domain? Maybe you should try to build a flask dashboard. If you're able to generate new predictions based on some limited data, a rest endpoint that people can pull up on their phones is really great here. If you want more of a narrative format, slides or excellently marked down notebooks can work here. Give some justification for how you'd like to present your work. n.b. - don't just put slides because you are concerned about time. You can always use this as a fall back if things slide, but be adventurous at the project outset.

What are your data sources
You'll want to have specific sources of data identified. You can either use web scrapping or APIs to collect data. If it's the latter, you should probably use the API during the proposal process to ensure the dataset has the right fields to address your problems. Also note, that one week is short timeline for going through an entire project. As such, you should have every bite of data on day one of capstones. As your thinking about choosing between projects, collecting as much data on each topic is really useful in helping to inform what is possible.

## Idea 1

*High Level Description*:  What contributes to upward mobility?  By studying longitudinal data of a cohort of baby boomers, I will explore the socical as well as economic factors that factor into wage growth over a person's lifetime.  I'm interested in the concept of the glass ceiling, the idea that women often reach a point in their careers where they are offered fewer chances for advancement.  There are likely many factors that contribute to wage growth in addition to gender: industry, race, education, geographic region, family structure, attitudes about discriminiation, etc and I will study these factors as well.

*Approach*: The National Longitudinal Study of Youth (1979) provides longitudinal demographic infortmation of people born in the years 1957 - 1964 so I could potentially track hundreds of details about these people's lives over the course of the years 1979 - 2016.  From the data I will pull a large number of factors that I believe could affect someone's wage growth in their life and use linear regression to do inferential analyses, teasing out the factors that most greatly affect wage growth as well testing the predictive power of my model.  I also may use a random forest regressor because of the number of potential interactions within variables that mean that a linear relationship cannot be assumed.

*How will people interact with your work*: There are likely many factors that contribute to wage growth, not all explained by outright workplace discrimination, but could be co-linear or have an interaction with being in a marginalized group, such as education opportunities, whether you grew up above or below the poverty level, and expectations surrounding motherhood for women.  This could have implications for policy, both at the governmental level as well as at the business and education level.
